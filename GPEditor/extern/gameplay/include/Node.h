     * objects instead of rigid bodies to allow more direct control over character movement,
     * since attempting to model a physics character with a simulated rigid body usually results
     * in unresponsive and unpredictable character movement. Unlike normal ghost objects,
     * characters to react to other characters and rigid bodies in the world. Characters react
